# EDA-on-Boston-Housing-Data

Welcome to the Boston Housing Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this repository, you will find the code and analysis for conducting an in-depth exploration of the Boston Housing dataset. The project aims to uncover insights into the factors that influence housing prices in the Boston area.

## Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset has been widely used in the field of machine learning and regression analysis. It contains information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset consists of 506 instances and 14 attributes, including features such as per capita crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and identify key factors that impact housing prices. The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded into the Python environment and any necessary preprocessing steps are performed, such as handling missing values or scaling features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: A variety of statistical analyses and visualizations are conducted to explore the dataset. This includes calculating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, examining correlations between features, and identifying relationships with the target variable.

3. Insights and Interpretations: Based on the EDA results, insightful findings and interpretations are derived. These insights shed light on the dynamics of the housing market, the influence of specific features on housing prices, and potential factors affecting property values.
